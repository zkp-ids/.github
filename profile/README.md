### ZKP: id


#### Overview
We propose a protocol for proving ownership of a Centralized identity (Residence ID) in a privacy-preserving manner. This protocol allows users to generate a ZK proof of their identity by revealing only the necessary information to an application. Developers can integrate this into their applications to verify user identities without accessing excessive personal data. The proof can be verified on EVM-based blockchains, making it suitable for on-chain applications.


### How It Works

1. Aadhaar data is signed by the government.
2. We will use Zero-knowledge circuits and verify this signature and generate proof.
3. A verifier (app or smart contract) can confirm the proverâ€™s valid Aadhaar containing the revealed information (e.g., age, state, gender).
